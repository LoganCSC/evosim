### Evosim
#####A three-dimensional, real time simulation of natural selection.

[Download executable from itch.io](http://rlomax.itch.io/evosim)

This is a proof of concept with the intention of testing how capable today's consumer computing power is simulating artificial genepools, which are likely to contain many 3D rigidbodies.

##### Usage
It is recommended to make sure that you have checked out to the `develop` branch since `master` is likely to be out of date.

Clone this repository and open the directory as an existing project in Unity3D, open the scene named 'Main' and make sure that the script named 'Main' is attached to the GameObject named 'Main' in the hierarchy.
